# NumPy Practice Homework

Goal: Help to understand NumPy basics through simple tasks.

Covers: arrays, reshaping, axis, comparisons, basic OOP integration.

**Task 1 – Create NumPy Arrays**


Create a 1D array of numbers from 1 to 10.

Create a 2D array with shape (3,3).

Print the array and its shape.

**Task 2 – Reshape Practice**


Given an array of 12 elements, reshape it to (3,4).

Then reshape it to (2,6).

Explain why reshape does not change array data.

**Task 3 – Axis Practice (mean, sum)**


Create a 3x3 matrix.

Compute mean along axis=0.

Compute sum along axis=1.

Explain what each axis means.

**Task 4 – Comparison Operations**


Create an array of 10 random integers.

Find values greater than the mean.

Return them as a new array.

**Task 5 – Masking and Filtering**


Create an array 0–20.

Extract even numbers using a Boolean mask.

Extract numbers divisible by 3.

**Task 6 – Small OOP + NumPy**


Write class MatrixTool:

- method row_mean() → row-wise means
- 
- method above_threshold(t) → values > t
- 
Use NumPy arrays as input.

**Task 7 – Mini Challenge**


Generate a 5x5 random matrix.

Replace values < 0.5 with 0.

Replace values ≥ 0.5 with 1.

Learn thresholding + masking.
