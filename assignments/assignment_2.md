# Library Management System
**Task: Write a simple Python program to manage a small library.Use list, tuple, set, dictionary, functions, modules/packages, and a standard library.**

**requirments:**
List
Create a list of book titles.

books = ["Python 101", "Data Science", "Machine Learning"]

Tuple:
Each book should be stored as a tuple (title, author, year).

book1 = ("Python 101", "John Smith", 2020)

Set:
Store a set of unique genres of the library.

genres = {"Programming", "AI", "Math"}

Dictionary:
Store books in a dictionary where the key is the book ID and the value is the book tuple.

library = {
    1: ("Python 101", "John Smith", 2020),
    2: ("Data Science", "Alice Brown", 2021)
}

Functions:
Write functions such as:

add_book(library, id, book) → Add a new book

search_book(library, title) → Search for a book by title

list_books(library) → Print all books

Module/Package:
Save your functions in a separate file library_utils.py (module).
Import and use them in main.py.
Standard Library
Use the random library to suggest a random book for reading.

learning goal:
Practice with list, tuple, set, dictionary
Write and use functions
Organize code with modules/packages
Apply a standard Python library (random)
